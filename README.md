# WG Readme Generator

This is a NodeJS application that generates a high quality and professional README.md file. The program will prompt the user for information to populate the readme file with (eg. title, description, usage, etc) and will save the file in the same directory as the program. 

## Installation

Install usinng git clone:

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:wilgru/USYDBC-WG-09-Readme-Generator.git
```

## Usage

Run the app in your terminal using node:

``` bash
node index.js
```

From there you will be prompted will a series of numbered questions, where the next will appear after the current one has been answered. Enter a response for each question and once all the questions have been answered, a README.md file will be created in the same directory as the index.js file.
